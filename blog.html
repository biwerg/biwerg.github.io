                I did not have very many challenges completing this assignment. I found Git very easy to use. The only thing I needed to figure out was how to make a commit. I knew the command, but when it prompted me to add a message I couldn't figure out how to save the message and proceed with the commit. I eventually realized it was VIM and I pressed escape followed by :wq in order to save the message

                I did not learn very much HTML from this assignment as I have learned the basics previously, but it was a good refresher to remind me of how HTML works. This was also my first time using Git so I got some good practice with that

                I did not use any resources aside from notes I took in class. Since we have already walked through everything required in this assignment during class, I was able to follow along with my notes and never ran into any issues
