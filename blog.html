                I did not have very many challenges completing this assignment. I found Git very easy to use. The only thing I needed to figure out was how to make a commit. I knew the command, but when it prompted me to add a message I couldn't figure out how to save the message and proceed with the commit. I eventually realized it was VIM and I pressed escape followed by :wq in order to save the message

                I did not learn very much HTML from this assignment as I have learned the basics previously, but it was a good refresher to remind me of how HTML works. This was also my first time using Git so I got some good practice with that

                I did not use any resources aside from notes I took in class. Since we have already walked through everything required in this assignment during class, I was able to follow along with my notes and never ran into any issues

                I had a hard time learning how to position everything correctly. Often times I would repositon one thing, and it would mess up another box. I solved these problems eventually through trial and error. I still need more practice before I'm fully confident in how positioning works.

                There are a lot of skills around web development that I have never done before. Creating a page that is *somewhat* visually appealing rather then a block of un-stylized html code was much more difficult than I had anticipated.

                I rewatched many of the lecture recordings as well as used W3 schools to help learn about many of the quirks and various commands you can do with css

                I had to google many things, including how to change the link within a specific class (I could only find out how to change all links) as well as how to make things appear on the same line. I was having a lot of issues with inline display and couldn't quite figure out what I was doing wrong.
